Application  Overview
-------------
The application which we have created for the Gesture Based UI module is a checkers/draughts game made in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and Visual Studio 15 using [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and Cortana. The idea of the game is that the users will be able to start and setup the game using voice activation controlled by Cortana and control the movement of the pieces using the Leap Motion. Our Checkers game will be multi-player across two devices.
